The Oracle query optimizer is cost-based, that is, it
	enumerates a number of alternatives for an access path, join method, join order, transformation,
	invokes the cost engine for every alternative,
	selects the alternative that has been assigned the lowest cost.

	
The cost model is one of the pillars of the query optimizer. Others include:
selectivity estimator
transformations engine
search engine.

Figure <> shows the query optimizer architecture, in terms of components and how they interact with each other.
The selectivity estimator is completely independent of the rest of the optimizer components. Changing the cost model will have a great impact on the execution plans 
generated by the query optimizer. What makes this task difficult is that we do not have a good methodology for validating the computation made by the cost model.
